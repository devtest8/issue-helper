## Before You Start...



The issue list is reserved exclusively for bug reports and feature requests. That means we do not accept usage questions. If you open an issue that does not conform to the requirements, **it will be closed immediately**.

For usage questions, please follow the steps below:

- Read through all the contents on the page
- And again...
- And again...
- And in 99.99% of all the cases this should solve your problem
    - and we believe you are NOT the 0.01%.

Also try to search for your issue - it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch. However, if you find that an old, closed issue still persists in the latest version, you should open a new issue using the form below instead of commenting on the old issue.
